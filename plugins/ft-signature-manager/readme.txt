FT Signature Manager allows your authors to create a signature to be appended to the end of their posts.

== Description ==

This simple little plugin gives each author on your blog the ability to setup a signature and to include it at the bottom of their posts.

The admin screen gives each author the ability to format their signature (a text area with HTML formatting enabled) and to indicate whether or not they want the signature on or off by default.

Regardless of the default setting, your authors may toggle the inclusion of the signature to 'on' or 'off' for each individual post at the bottom of the Write Post and Edit Post screens.
